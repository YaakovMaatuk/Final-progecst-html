          <h1 style="color: darkblue;">Three in a row: Real Madrid make more history</h1>
          <h1 style="color: darkcyan;">Real Madrid have become the first club to win three straight European Cup finals for the second time.</h1>
          <p style=" font-style:italic; color black; font-size: large;" > 
            Real Madrid have made yet another piece of UEFA Champions League history. The 3-1 win against Liverpool in Kyiv was their third final triumph in a row in the competition – making them the first team to do so on more than one occasion.

Since Madrid reached (and won) the first five European Cup finals between 1956 and 1960, only five other clubs had even reached three in a row – Benfica, Ajax, Bayern and, in the UEFA Champions League era, AC Milan and Juventus.

1960 final: When Madrid won five in a row
Remarkably, in all those previous cases, when one team reached three in a row, another club immediately matched that feat. But now Madrid have not just made three in a row, but they have won them all, taking them to within two of what seemed a
 never-to-be repeated record from the first half-decade of this competition's history.

              <h1>2016 UEFA Champions League Final</h1>
              <p style=" font-style:italic; color: slategrey; font-size: large;" >
                The 2016 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League, the 61st season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 24th season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the San Siro stadium in Milan, Italy, on 28 May 2016,[5] between Spanish teams Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid, in a repeat of the 2014 final. It was the second time in the tournament's history that both finalists were from the same city. Real Madrid won 5–3 on a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw at the end of extra time, securing a record-extending 11th title in the competition.

                Real Madrid earned the right to play against the winners of the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League, Sevilla, in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup. They also qualified to enter the 
                semi-finals of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup as the UEFA representative.    </p>

                  <p style=" font-style:italic; color: slategrey; font-size: large;" >
                    The 2017 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League,
                     the 62nd season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 25th season since it was renamed from the European Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales on 3 June 2017,[5] between Italian side Juventus and Spanish side and title holders Real Madrid, in a repeat of the 1998 final. It would also be the first-ever European Cup final held under a closed roof. Real Madrid won the match 4–1 to secure their 12th title in this competition. With this victory, as the defending champions, Real Madrid became the first-ever team to successfully defend their title in the Champions League era, and the first to do so since Milan in 1990. On the other hand, Juventus lost a fifth final in a row and a seventh in nine finals reached.

                    Real Madrid qualified as the UEFA representative at the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, and also earned the right to play against the winners
                     of the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League, Manchester United, in the 2017 UEFA Super Cup.

                    <h1>2018 UEFA Champions League Final</h1>
                    <p style=" font-style:italic; color: slategrey; font-size: large;" >
                      The 2018 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, the 63rd season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 26th season since it was renamed from the European Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium in Kiev, Ukraine on 26 May 2018,[5] between Spanish side and defending champions Real Madrid, who had won the competition in each of the last two seasons, and English side Liverpool.[6][7]

After Liverpool's Sadio Mané cancelled out Karim Benzema's opener for Real Madrid, two goals from man of the match Gareth Bale proved the difference in a 3–1 win for Los Blancos, making them the first team to win three back-to-back titles in Champions League era and the first since Bayern Munich defeated Saint-Étienne in the 1976 European Cup Final; it was additionally their fourth title in five seasons and their 13th European Cup overall. They also earned the right to play the winners of the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League, Atlético Madrid, in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup and to enter the semi-finals of the 2018 FIFA Club World Cup. They also qualified to enter the group stage of the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League,[8] but since they already qualified through their league performance, the berth reserved was given to the champions of the
 2017–18 Czech First League, the 11th-ranked association according to next season's access list.   </p>
